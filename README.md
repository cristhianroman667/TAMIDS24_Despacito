# Coastal Area Submergence Analysis

This repository contains the data analysis and visualization code for assessing submergence risks of coastal areas due to sea level rise. The analysis focuses on Ramsar wetlands, identifying vulnerable marshlands and wetlands prone to future submersion.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes elevation data and wetland statistics to predict the impact of rising sea levels on coastal ecosystems. It includes:

- Elevation analysis to determine high-risk areas.
- Gradient analysis correlating risk with elevation and forest cover.
- Visual representations of areas at risk of submersion.
